Smart Dustbin: An efficient garbage tracking system

Objectives:

Develop a smart trash can using Arduino UNO module and ultrasonic sensor.
The development of an automated system reduces the human workload regarding the cleanliness of the environment.

Problems:

Trash can overflowing.
Improper waste management.
People who do not attend to their duties.
Lack of bins in a specific location.

This proposed system addresses three related issues:

1)Ease in human daily life duties.
2)Efficient in terms of time and fuel costs.
3)Tells us the importance of not filling the dustbins after getting loaded, empty them and then fill again.



Methodology:

The methodology will be adopted as follows:

We can use different kinds of sensors such as IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor and weight sensor to detect whether the dust bag is filled or not. An ultrasonic sensor is used in the project.

Some of the other devices used in the project are Arduino, jumper cables (male and female), battery*, dust container, Arduino holder, etc.

We placed the ultrasonic sensor on the top of the bin where the ultrasonic waves can interact with the trash inside the bin.

The ultrasonic sensor sends data and tells the Arduino about the amount of waste in the bin.

And the Arduino uploads the data captured by the ultrasonic sensor.

Although that person would know when to change or clean the litter box.



Result:

The result we get would be the processed data of the Arduino connected to the bin.
This project will also result in a better and cleaner environment.
This project will also lead to better coordination in the cleanliness system of small campuses.
This project will lead to an environment where the distance between man and technology would be smaller.
